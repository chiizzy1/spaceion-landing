# Client Brief: Spaceion (Series A Redesign)

## 1. Company Background

- **Company Name:** Spaceion (pronounced "Space-Ion")
- **Status:** Series A Funded ($18M led by Sequoia/Index).
- **Product:** The world's first "Universal Compute Protocol" for autonomous AI agents.
  - _What it does:_ Allows developers to deploy AI agents that can "hop" between clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure) instantly based on cost/latency.
- **Current State:** The current website is just a ReadMe file on GitHub and a stark white page with a login.
- **The Problem:** Investors love the tech, but Enterprise CIOs think it's a "risk" because it looks like a hobby project.
- **The Opportunity:** Series A capital is in the bank. Now we need to look like a $100M company to hire top talent and sign Fortune 500 pilots.

## 2. Project Goals

1.  **The "Enterprise Gradient" Shift:** Move from "Hacker Cool" to "Enterprise Trusted".
    - _Success Metric:_ Increase Enterprise Pilot signups by 40%.
2.  **Investor Signaling:** Show we are ready for Series B. The site must scream "Scalable", "Secure", and "Global".
3.  **Recruiting Magnet:** Top engineers want to work on "beautiful" infrastructure (think Linear, Vercel, Stripe). The design is a recruiting tool.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Primary (Customers):** CTOs and VP Engineering at Post-Series B scaleups. They care about _reliability_ and _compliance_.
- **Secondary (Investors):** VCs looking for the "next big infrastructure play". They care about _narrative_ and _market dominance_.
- **Tertiary (Talent):** 10x Engineers who judge code quality by the landing page aesthetic.

## 4. Brand Intelligence

- **Archetype:** The "Architect". Precision, Order, Structure.
- **Voice:**
  - **Confident, not Arrogant:** "We power the next generation." vs "We are the best."
  - **Concise/Minimalist:** "127ms turbo-start containers." (Don't explain what a container is; our audience knows).
  - **Opinionated:** We believe the future is multi-cloud. The design should feel "inevitable".
- **Aesthetic (The "Vibe"):**
  - **Neo-Minimalism:** Stark white backgrounds, heavy black typography. "Swiss Style".
  - **Light Mode Only:** We are confident enough to be bright. No "dark mode to hide bad design".
  - **Invisible Tech:** The complexity is hidden. The interface is Zen.

## 5. Key Content Requirements (For the Landing Page)

- **Hero Headline:** Must be bold.
  - _Draft:_ "The Universal Runtime for AI Agents."
  - _Sub:_ "Deploy once. Run anywhere. Zero friction."
- **The "Trust Battery":** We need to feature the 3 pilot logos we have (big ones) + our investors (Sequoia link).
- **The "Physics" of the Product:**
  - Use the "01 / 02 / 03" list to explain the _process_:
    1.  **Deploy:** Push to Git.
    2.  **Orchestrate:** Spaceion routes the compute.
    3.  **Scale:** Infinite horizontal scaling.
- **The "Problem" Section:**
  - "Stop managing 14 different cloud credentials." (Pain).
  - "One API key. Infinite compyte." (Solution).

## 6. Design Non-Negotiables

- **No "Marketing Fluff":** No stock photos of people shaking hands.
- **No "Jiggly" Animations:** Motion must be physics-based (springs). It should feel like a _tool_, not a _toy_.
- **Typography is King:** The font hierarchy must be perfect. (Reference: The footer "Mega-type").
